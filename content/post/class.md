**Information:** There is little prerequisite for this class other than
knowing a programming language. However, we had dedicated students with no
programming background that got an A+ in class. Links to registrar:

Both classes are the same. They are just listed in different
departments. These classes can be taken by anyone at the university. The
weekly agenda is posted at:

* [Lecture Notes](https://laszewski.github.io/book/e516/)

Online students will have the opportunity to attend a weekly online
meeting. The time for that will be determined based on a poll posted in the class
piazza.

Residential students are required to attend our in person Lab. Please be
advised that residential students must sign up for the Friday Lab
session also:

Online students having the ability to participate in the Friday meeting
in BLoomingtopn are welcom to join Fridays in person instead of the
online meetings.

 
**Note:** Students taking this class have access to our Lab space in the
building I am in if you like to use it (optional). I have 8 office
spaces, so you could have your own office space if you like. You
however can do your work anywhere. Free transportation is provided.
After hour access to the building can be arranged.

**Undergraduates:** Advanced undergraduates with Python knowledge are
allowed to take the class with permission from Gregor and the
department. Please contact me via e-mail if you like to take the class
and are qualified. The space for undergraduates is limited.
