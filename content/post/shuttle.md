Hello Engineering Students, Faculty, and Staff!
 
As the semester approaches, I wanted to remind everyone that there is a
shuttle to transport ISE students and personnel between Luddy Hall and
MESH during the academic year when class is in session.
 
Shuttle Service between Luddy Hall & MESH is available 

* **Monday – Friday from 8AM – 5PM**

from IU Fleet Services DSS Van Service.  Call
812-855-5043 at least 10 minutes before a ride is needed to request a
ride.  Shuttle requests can be scheduled hours or days in advance as
well.
 
Service will start Monday, August 26th and will follow the academic
calendar for holidays and breaks.
 
The pickup / drop off locations at both buildings are: Luddy
Hall—Pickup/Drop Off from the corner of 11th Street and Cottage Grove
MESH—Pickup/Drop Off at either north or east entrance, but please
specify which when requesting service.  North is the main ISE entrance
at the far end of the parking lots, east is the CEEM entrance you
typically drive past to get to the north entrance.  We encourage you to
use the north entrance, but if you must use the east entrance, please do
not ask CEEM staff for directions or assistance.  ISE staff at the north
entrance are happy to help you find whatever room you are looking for.
 
Riders need to be at the pick-up location at the time requested –
drivers are on a schedule and cannot wait for riders for extended
periods of time.  Driver will leave if the rider is not at the pick-up
location within one minute of the requested time.  If a ride is missed,
riders will have to call and request another ride.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if any issues arise.  I
hope you have a wonderful semester!
 
Cheers,
Julie
