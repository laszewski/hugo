**Note:** Students taking this class have access to our Lab space in the
building I am in if you like to use it (optional). I have 8 office
spaces, so you could have your own office space if you like. You
however can do your work anywhere. Free transportation is provided.
After hour access to the building can be arranged.

**Undergraduates:** Advanced undergraduates with Python knowledge are
allowed to take the class with permission from Gregor and the
department. Please contact me via e-mail if you like to take the class
and are qualified. The space for undergraduates is limited.

## ENGR-E616

* Not offered in the Fall, but you can use an independent study with
  Gregor in the Fall 2019 semester. Contact him at <laszewski@gmail.com>
  Independent studies will work on programming projects, advanced cloud
  topics, or conference/workshop papers.
