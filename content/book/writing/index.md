An important part of any scientific research is to communicate and document it.
Previously we used LaTeX in this class to provide the ability to contribute
professional looking documents. As part of this we also noticed that any
document from any student that ever submitted a document in MSWord was
inferior to those using structured documents such as provided by LaTeX or
markdown. Although we would have loved to continue our work in LaTeX, a
small number of students made the full adaptation of LaTeX as document system
not possible. Thus we have adopted an even simpler approach. All documents
written for this class are written in structured markdown. As we use a uniform
format all documents in the class will be made available online, including your
project reports. This allows anyone giving feedback to the class artifacts and not
only by the instructors. It also allows open sharing of ideas as any project in
class must be unique and must not have been previously done. If it has been, a
significant enhancement must be made.

While using markdown and github, you will also be able to collaboratively write
documents in a group, while the instructors can inspect who has contributed to
the document what while utilizing the history of the document.
In addition we will be able to use bibtex as reference manager and leverage
hundrets of thousands professionally curated bibliography citations while not
needing to worry about IEEE, ACM, or APA style formating requirements. The
bibliography format is automatically created for you. In particular markdown is
very useful for creating deployment and code documentations through easy to
use verbatim or code environments. At the same time it allows us to use
mathematical equations as defined in LaTeX and avoid images for equation
inclusion.
