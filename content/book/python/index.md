Python is an easy to learn programming language. It has efficient
high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to
object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s simple syntax and dynamic typing,
together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for
scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most
platforms.

This online book will provide you with enough information so
that you can conduct your programming for the cloud in python.

You are encouracged to contribute to this book. Participants from e516
are expected to contribute as part of their class activities.
