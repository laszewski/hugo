Here you find the Lecture notes for e516. PLease com back to this page
as we will update it weekly. Updates will typically tacke place Friday
at midnight.

The best we to read them is with an ePub reader. If you do not have one
you also use the PDF version. However, PDF does not render as well as
ePub.
