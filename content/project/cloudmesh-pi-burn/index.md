## cm-burn

* github: <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm-burn>

`cm-burn` is a program to burn many SD cards for the preparation of
building clusters with Raspberry Pi's.  The program is developed in
Python and is portable on Linux, Windows, and OSX. It allows users to
create readily bootable SD cards that have the network configured,
contain a public ssh key from your machine that you used to configure
the cards.  The unique feature is that you can burn multiple cards in
a row.

A sample command invocation looks like:

```
cm-burn —-name  red[5-7] \
        --key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
        —-ips 192.168.1.[5-7] \
        —-image 2018-06-27-raspbian-stretch
```
        
This command creates 3 SD cards where the hostnames `red5`, `red6`, `red 7`
with the network addresses `192.168.1.5`, `192.168.1.6`,
and `192.168.1.7`. The public key is added to the authorized_keys file
of the pi user.  The password login is automatically disabled and only
the ssh key authentication is enabled.
